# Assignments Directory  
ITAI Applied AI and Robotics Program  
Author: John Nguyen  

## Overview  
This directory contains individual assignments completed across the Applied AI and Robotics program.  
These assignments show focused work on specific skills such as preprocessing model training evaluation visualization and core Python development.  
Each assignment builds toward the larger course projects found in the main portfolio structure.

## Contents  
Assignments included here may come from multiple courses and may include:

- Data preprocessing exercises  
- Exploratory notebooks  
- Model training labs  
- Evaluation reports  
- Small coding tasks  
- Written analysis or theory based work  

Each assignment folder includes a short README to explain the goal of the task and its outcome.
