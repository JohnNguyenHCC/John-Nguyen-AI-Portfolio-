# NLP Course Portfolio  
ITAI 2373 Natural Language Processing  
Author: John Nguyen  

## Overview  
This directory highlights the major NLP projects completed for ITAI 2373.  
It includes end to end systems that process text, classify content, extract insight, and apply modern NLP methods.  
The work here reflects skills in preprocessing, TF IDF features, classification models, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, summarization, semantic search, multilingual processing, and conversational interfaces.

## Projects Included  
### 1. NewsBot Midterm  
A full NLP pipeline that performs preprocessing, TF IDF extraction, POS and syntax analysis, sentiment scoring, entity extraction, and multi class classification.  
It applies core NLP techniques from Modules 1 through 8.

**Key Features**  
- TF IDF feature engineering  
- POS and dependency parsing  
- NER extraction  
- Sentiment and emotion analysis  
- Multi class classifier  
- Business insight reporting  

### 2. NewsBot 2.0 Final Project  
An advanced upgrade that expands the midterm system into a production style news intelligence platform.

**Key Features**  
- Improved SVM classification  
- Topic modeling with LDA  
- Sentiment and tone analysis  
- Extractive and abstractive summaries  
- Semantic search with transformer embeddings  
- Multilingual translation  
- Natural language query interface  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Text preprocessing and normalization  
- Feature engineering  
- Classical ML models for NLP  
- Topic modeling  
- Sentiment and tonal interpretation  
- Summarization methods  
- Semantic similarity search  
- Multilingual analysis  
- Pipeline design and system integration
